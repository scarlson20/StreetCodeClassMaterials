# Street Code Class Materials
These are the materials I created in my internship last summer for programs I helped to teach and run. The overviews were created in collaboration with the lead teacher of Intro to Hack. I created the teaching guide for the Generations United program to startup technology classes after running the technology day of their summer STEAM camps.

This was the website I used during my technology days to give the kids an easy way to access everything without typing in links.
